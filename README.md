# Real-Time--Phone-Tracker
üìç Phone Number Location Tracker
This project is a Python-based tool that allows you to trace the approximate location of a phone number using public APIs and libraries. It utilizes phonenumbers, geocoder, folium, and the OpenCage Geocoding API to fetch and visualize the phone number‚Äôs general location on a map.

üöÄ Features
  - Extracts country, region, and service provider from a phone number.
  - Retrieves geographical coordinates using OpenCage API.
  - Displays the location on an interactive map with folium.
  - Simple and beginner-friendly Python implementation.
  
üõ† Requirements
   Install the required Python packages:
   
    pip install phonenumbers
    pip install folium
    pip install geocoder
    pip install opencage

You also need to create an account at OpenCage Geocoder to obtain a free API key.

üîê OpenCage API Key

   To use OpenCage:
   
    - Sign up at opencagedata.com
    - Get your API key
    - Replace "YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY" in the script with your key
    
   key = "YOUR_OPENCAGE_API_KEY"
   geocoder_api = OpenCageGeocode(key)

üíª Usage
  1. Run the Script:
      pythontracker.py
  2. Input the phone number in international format(eg,.+441632960961).
  3. The script will:
      - Phares and extraction location details.
      - Use Opencage to get latituted and longitude.
      - Gendrate an HTML map with a marker for the location.

üì§ Sample Output

     Location: California
     Carrier: Verizon Wireless
     Latitude: 36.7783
     Longitude: -119.4179
